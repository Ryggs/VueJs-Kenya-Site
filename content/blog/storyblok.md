### What is a headless CMS ?

A headless CMS is a tool that helps people manage the content on a website or application.

It doesn't have a front part that people can see, so it doesn't control how the content looks to the users. Instead, it lets the developers ( me and you ) create our own unique designs using different programming languages.

### Importance of CMS in web development.
